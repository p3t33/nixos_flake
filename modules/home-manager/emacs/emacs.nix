# programs.emcas.extraConfig is responsible to create a configuration file for
# Emacs but this file, although interpreted as init.el(in logs) isn't located in ~/.emacs.d.

# The imports will create programs.emcas.extraConfig that creates the configuration files
# that will be evaluated by emacs. extraConfig is "stitched" from multiple files and
# the order in which they are imported is important.
#
# I did use use-package with :after to control how the packages are evaluated but I can't
# be sure it is covering 100% of all the edge cases, so the order should be kept as is.
